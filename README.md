# Investment Preference Analysis

“Every investment tells a story—not just about money, but about trust, fear, and ambition.”

## Project Overview

I recently completed an Investment Preference Analysis project — not just to understand where people put their money, but why.

Behind every investment is a decision shaped by age, motivation, and life goals. With Power BI, I turned raw financial behavior into a visual narrative — revealing patterns that can help financial advisors, fintech startups, and policymakers speak to their audiences with precision.

This project wasn't just about analyzing data. It was about decoding the emotional and logical choices that define people’s financial lives.

## Business Problem

**Objective:**  
To understand how different demographics approach investing — their motivations, preferred instruments, and what influences their decisions — in order to drive targeted advisory, personalized product offerings, and meaningful engagement strategies.

---

## About the Dataset

The dataset consisted of anonymized survey-style responses detailing:

- Age group and gender
- Investment preferences (e.g., Mutual Funds, Equity, PPF)
- Financial motivations (returns, security, tax savings)
- Long- and short-term savings goals

Collected as part of a behavioral finance training project under Quantum Analytics NG.

## Data Preparation (Power Query in Power BI)

To ensure quality and integrity, I performed the following:

- **Removed missing values** and standardized blanks
- **Eliminated duplicates** to ensure clean respondent tracking
- **Corrected inconsistent categories** across fields like age and gender
- **Changed data types** (e.g., numeric to categorical) to enable proper visual filtering
- **Created calculated columns and custom labels** for clearer dashboard segmentation
- Built relationships between fact and dimension tables for optimal model performance

## Key KPIs

- **Top Investment Avenues by Age Group**
- **Savings Objectives by Demographics** (Retirement, Education, Healthcare)
- **Top Motivations for Mutual Fund Investments**
- **Investment Factors by Age** (Returns, Risk Appetite, Lock-in Period)
- **Preferred Investment Type by Gender**

---

## Insights That Stood Out

- **Established Adults** (typically aged 36–50) led with 588 investment entries — suggesting a highly engaged and active investor segment.
- **Early Adults** were more exploratory, leaning into Equity and PPF with a clear focus on returns and exposure to risk.
- **Mutual Funds** were a universally trusted option — especially among cautious or first-time investors.
- **By gender**, males favored equities more heavily, but both genders saw Mutual Funds as the reliable middle ground.
- **Retirement Planning** topped savings goals among older adults, while education and healthcare barely featured — particularly among younger demographics.

## Recommendations

1. **Personalized Financial Advisory**  
   Use behavioral segmentation to tailor recommendations for Early Adults vs. Established Adults.

2. **Fintech Product Optimization**  
   Build smarter investment suggestion engines that take into account age-based risk profiles and savings intent.

3. **Policy & Financial Literacy Campaigns**  
   Educational and healthcare savings awareness needs reinforcement, especially for youth segments that underestimate long-term needs.

4. **Gender-Sensitive Positioning**  
   Marketing equity products more effectively to women and providing trust-building content may increase diversification in their portfolios.

5. **Data-Backed Onboarding Journeys**  
   Use initial investor motivations (e.g., returns or tax savings) to craft onboarding flows that feel personally relevant.

## Final Note

Financial decisions aren’t just rational — they’re emotional, cultural
